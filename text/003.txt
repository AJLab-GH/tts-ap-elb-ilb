First, let's explore the strengths of this architecture. It's designed for high availability and resilience. From a resource perspective, it deploys two FortiGate VMs in an active/passive setup, utilizing External, and Internal Load Balancers. This setup ensures failover times ranging between 10 and 20 seconds. It also means there's no need to modify the traffic with network address translation to avoid symmetry issues. The architecture leverages multiple network interfaces, including reserved interfaces for Management and high availability. The solution can be deployed within existing or new virtual networks, providing robust security while maintaining cost-effectiveness and resource efficiency.
